# Quiz Game

This game was one of my first experiences with Object Oriented Programming.
It initially started with me using hardcoded data to generate questions but I felt I could take the functionality further. Using my prior knowledge of apis I was able to use the Open Trivia DB to dynamically give me new questions everytime the quiz is run. This not only made the quiz more dynamic, but also mad it more fun since now you never know what question you are going to get.

## Also the quiz questions are set to "hard" so be careful if you take on this quiz
